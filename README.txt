Forked from the popular WordPress [Search Everything](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search-everything/) plugin, Combined Search allows you to search all available content types on your web site.


== Description ==

In today’s world, no WordPress Site Administrator should be without Combined Search. This uniquely formulated WordPress Plugin has been developed to allow Site Administrators like you to search for content that could not previously be searched for – like comments, category names, descriptions, custom taxonomies, and more.

You can configure Combined Search to your heart’s content, enabling it to search pages, attachments, excerpts, drafts, tags, comments, metadata and (most) everything in-between. Need to exclude certain pages and posts? Done.

Getting started is easy. Install via the WordPress dashboard or manually by downloading the plugin and adding it to your `wp-content/plugins/` folder. Visit the Plugins page in your WordPress administration area, and click “*activate*”. Configure it to your liking, and you’re ready to start searching.

**PS:** *The only thing you can’t search is password-protected content, naturally. Combined Search can and will change the ability of the default WordPress Search; from highlighting to purely approved comments and so much more.*
