# Combined Search

Forked from the popular WordPress Search Everything plugin, Combined Search allows you to search all available content types on your web site.

## Description

In today’s world, no WordPress Site Administrator should be without Combined Search. This
uniquely formulated WordPress Plugin has been developed to allow Site Administrators like you to
search for content that could not previously be searched for – like comments, category names,
descriptions, custom taxonomies, and more.

You can configure Combined Search to your heart’s content, enabling it to search pages,
attachments, excerpts, drafts, tags, comments, metadata and (most) everything in-between. Need
to exclude certain pages and posts? Done.

Getting started is easy. Install via the WordPress dashboard or manually by downloading the plugin and
adding it to your `wp-content/plugins/` folder. Visit the Plugins page in your WordPress administration area,
and click “*activate*”. Configure it to your liking, and you’re ready to start searching.

**PS:** The only thing you can’t search is password-protected content, naturally. Combined Search
can and will change the ability of the default WordPress Search; from highlighting to purely
approved comments and so much more.
